- we enclose the expression between two forward slashes
Eg: / regex /

- if you wanna match a word `regular` in a string of texts, you would do
1. `/ star /`
2. `/ texts /`

- this pattern of embedding a word / keyword in between two forward slashes differentiates regular expression text from normal string / text and is common for all flavours of regular expressions.
